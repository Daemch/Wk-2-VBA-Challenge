# Wk 2 VBA Challenge
 Hello my name is Danita,
The goal of this assignment is to show that, in combination with our class lessons and available resources,
each individual can create a VBA script that loops through raw data for each quarter to summarize:
The ticker symbol, 
Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter, 
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter,
And the total stock volume of each unique ticker. 

These inital tasks opened information to the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease,
and greatest total volume; all valuable analytical metrics. 

Thank you!
